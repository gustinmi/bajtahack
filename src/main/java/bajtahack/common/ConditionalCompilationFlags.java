 * Static final variables are know in compile time.Therefore the code inside if like this :
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *    if (STATIC_FINAL_FALSE) callSomeMethod();
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * does not get included into compiled bytecode, beacuse the value of static final variables is known in compile time.
 * 
 * This patter is known also as java conditional compilation. Taken from book Hardcore Java.
